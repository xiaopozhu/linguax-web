# Logi Lift on Mac — Vertical Mouse, Side-Button Mapping

The Logi Lift's 57-degree vertical angle is what draws most Mac users to it — a neutral wrist position that reduces pronation strain over an 8-hour workday. LinguaX has the Lift on its recognition list with full HID++ 2.0, so the side buttons and the DPI key on top all get click / long-press / directional-swipe gestures and per-app overrides — without Logi Options+ installed.

## What you can actually map on the Logi Lift

LinguaX exposes four configurable inputs on the Lift, plus L / R which macOS handles directly:

- **`S1` / `S2` (side buttons)** — the two thumb-side buttons (default Back / Forward). Full four-gesture layer: click / double-click / long-press / directional swipe.
- **`M` (wheel click)** — the middle button.
- **`T` (DPI / Pointer Speed key)** — the small button on top of the mouse, behind the wheel. Default action is DPI toggle; LinguaX exposes it in the T slot so you can rebind it to any shortcut or gesture. If you do rebind, you lose the DPI toggle unless you keep that action on it.

Named-slot reference: [Button & Side-Button Mapping](/docs/mouse-plus/fundamentals/button-mapping). Gesture-type semantics: [Gesture Mapping](/docs/mouse-plus/fundamentals/gesture-mapping).

## Why remap the Lift on Mac

The Lift is designed to reduce **wrist and forearm** strain. It doesn't reduce **keyboard reach** strain — that comes from constantly hitting shortcuts. Remapping the Lift's side buttons and top DPI key to your most-used shortcuts closes the ergonomics loop:

- **Push-to-talk on S2** — voice input for anything text-heavy, so your fingers rest.
- **Space switching on S1 swipe** — no more `⌃ ←` / `⌃ →` reaches.
- **Screenshot on T** — hand stays on the mouse; you accept trading the DPI toggle for a much more useful action.

Broader ergonomics discussion in [MX Ergo](./mx-ergo) for the trackball alternative.

## Three ready-to-copy setups

### 1. Push-to-talk on S2
For voice-first work:

- `S2 long-press` (200 ms) → **Hold** your PTT key (Superwhisper `Fn`, Wispr Flow `⌥`, Zoom `Space`)
- `S2 click` → keep Forward for browsing

More: [Push-to-Talk Voice Typing on Mac](/docs/push-to-talk/push-to-talk-voice-typing-mac).

### 2. Space switching with S1 swipe
Avoid the `⌃ ←` / `⌃ →` keyboard reach:

- `S1 swipe-left` → `⌃ ←`
- `S1 swipe-right` → `⌃ →`
- `S1 click` → keeps default Back

### 3. Top DPI key → Screenshot (trade DPI toggle for utility)
The T key on top is barely used once you pick a DPI you like. Reclaim it:

- `T click` → `⌘ ⇧ 4` (macOS area screenshot)
- Or `⌘ ⇧ 5` (screenshot menu) for more options
- Or `T long-press` → PTT key, keeping short click for DPI toggle

Full walkthrough: [App-Scoped Overrides](/docs/mouse-plus/fundamentals/app-scoped-overrides) for making T do different things per app.

## Setup in three minutes

1. **Install LinguaX** from [Installation](/docs/getting-started/installation).
2. **Pair the Lift.** Bluetooth pairs in System Settings. If your Lift shipped with a Bolt receiver, the [in-browser pairing tool](/tools/pair-logitech-receiver) can pair the receiver without Logi Options+.
3. **Open Mouse+.** LinguaX picks up the Lift via VID:PID + HID++ probing; you'll see S1, S2, M, T.
4. **Apply a recipe.** Push-to-talk on S2 pairs especially well with the Lift because voice input reduces the total time your wrist is engaged.

The [First Run](/docs/getting-started/first-run) guide covers macOS permission prompts.

## Compatibility notes

- **HID++ 2.0** — full profile support.
- **Vertical angle** — 57 degrees; comfortable transition from a flat mouse after a couple of days.
- **Left / right-handed variants** — LinguaX exposes identical named slots on both (buttons are mirrored).
- **Bluetooth + Bolt** — both work with LinguaX.
- **Battery** — shown in the tray via HID++.
- **Three Easy-Switch hosts** — separate LinguaX profile per host.

## FAQ

**Does the Logi Lift work on Mac without Logi Options+?**
Yes — LinguaX has the Lift on its recognition list with full HID++ 2.0. Adds side-button and DPI-key mapping without Options+ installed.

**What is the button on top of the Lift used for?**
DPI / Pointer Speed toggle by default. LinguaX exposes it as T so you can rebind — most users pick one DPI they like and reclaim T for a productivity action (screenshot, PTT, quick capture).

**Left- or right-handed on Mac?**
Both — Logitech ships mirrored variants. LinguaX supports both with identical slot names.

**Does LinguaX show battery for the Lift?**
Yes, via HID++ over Bluetooth or Bolt.
